        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Hi, I’m <strong>Antoine Romand</strong>, a full-stack software developer with a strong background in
            software architecture, backend development, and DevOps.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            I have several years of experience working on production applications, mainly around
            Java, Spring Boot, TypeScript, Angular, and modern API-driven architectures.
            I’ve contributed to the modernization of complex systems, from SOA migrations
            to the design of reusable backend and frontend components.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            After completing my Master’s degree and a full-stack apprenticeship, I expanded my
            perspective through international experiences, including a three-month stay in Tokyo
            and intensive English training. These experiences strengthened both my technical
            expertise and my adaptability.

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900">About PictsManager</h2>

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            PictsManager originally started as a 4th-year student project.
            At the beginning of 2026, I decided to take over the project and significantly
            improve it, with the ambition of turning it into a more mature and production-ready application.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            The project now focuses on clean architecture, modern development practices,
            scalability, and long-term maintainability. It serves both as a learning platform
            and a technical showcase of my approach to software engineering.
